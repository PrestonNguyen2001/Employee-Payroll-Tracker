# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Introduction
Welcome to the Employee Payroll Tracker project! This repository contains a starter code for an Employee Payroll Tracker web application. The application allows users to manage employee data, including first name, last name, and salary, and provides features to display and analyze the collected data.

## Functionality
The Employee Payroll Tracker offers the following functionality:
- Add Employees: Users can click the "Add Employees" button to add employee data, including first name, last name, and salary, through a series of prompts.
- Data Display: The collected employee data is displayed on the page in an HTML table, sorted alphabetically by last name.
- Data Analysis: The console logs computed and aggregated data, including the average salary of all employees and a randomly selected employee.

## How It Works
The application operates as follows:
1. Initialization: The application initializes with an empty employee roster displayed on the page.
2. Adding Employees: When users click the "Add Employees" button, they are prompted to enter employee details such as first name, last name, and salary. Users can continue adding employees or cancel the process.
3. Data Display: Upon completing the addition of employees, the employee data is displayed on the page in an HTML table, sorted alphabetically by last name.
4. Data Analysis: Computed and aggregated data, such as the average salary of all employees and a randomly selected employee, is logged to the console.
